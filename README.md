# Password generator - Challenge 3


## Description
This is a simple web application that generates a random password based on user preferences. The user can select the length of characters and types. They can include in their password, such as uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numerics, and special characters. To generate the password is mandatory to pick, at least, one type of the password characters. 

They can also choose the length of the password they want to generate in a range between 8 to 20. The value "8" is set in by default when you load the website. 

This app has built dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. Additionally, it is a responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.


## Getting started
